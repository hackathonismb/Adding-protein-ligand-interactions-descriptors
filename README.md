# Adding protein ligand interactions descriptors

* **Functional Groups & atom level interaction descriptors between organic molecules  ligands and proteins** 
* **PLIP or equivalent** 
* Analysis of protein-ligand interactions is critical to understand how endogenous ligands bind and how potential drug molecules can bind to orthosteric and allosteric binding sites in proteins. Membrane proteins like receptors present multiple allosteric sites, which can be rationally targeted by new drugs as these sites are less conserved than the orthosteric sites.
* Goal is to combine detailed information on ligand binding residues in proteins (in terms of biochemical interactions like salt-bridge, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi interactions, water-mediated interactions, etc.) with sequence/structure conservation analysis of the binding sites in related proteins, one can devise a rational strategy for drug design.
